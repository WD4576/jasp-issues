When opening JASP with a .csv data sheet with mutliple data sets requiring analysis, I attepted to duplicate my anlaysises and change a few parameters to save steps.  
This would also allow the project to be saved to one file.
This was all done sucsessfully.
When retreiving the file from the saved location, JASP would begin to start-up then crash.
Resolution was to do only one study per JASP file. This works but adds additional steps.
Additionally JASP files must be zipped to send on SKF email system or it is tagged as spam and not delivered.
